\section{Proof of Claim 2}

Suppose $Y_t = \{ y_{j_1}, ..., y_{j_k} \}$ is the visible subset of $Y_{i-1} = \{ y_1, ..., y_{i-1} \}$ where $t \leq i - 1$. Let $y_{j_k} \in Y_t$ be the last line in $Y_t$ such that $y_{j_k}(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}}) \geq y_i(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}})$ where $(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}}, y_{j_k}(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}}))$ is the intersection of lines $y_{j_k}$ and $y_{j_{k-i}}$. 

Let $Y_k = \{ y_{j_1}, ..., y_{j_k} \}$ where $k \leq t$ and $Y_k \subseteq Y_t$ and let $Y_i = \{ y_1, ..., y_i \}$. 

Let $Y_{k+i} = Y_k \cup \{ y_i \}$.

Suppose that $Y_{k+i}$ is \textit{not} the visible subset of $Y_i$. Then, $\exists y_m \in Y_{k+i}$ for which $y_m$ is not visible in $Y_i$. 

We know that $y_1$ and $y_i$ are visible in $Y_i$ because they have the lowest and highest slopes in $Y_i$. Therefore, since $y_m$ is not visible, $y_m$ can't be $y_i$, so $y_m \in Y_t$.

Since $y_m$ is not visible we know that $\forall y_p \in Y_i, \not\exists x$ such that $y_m(x) \geq y_p(x)$. However, since $Y_t$ is the visible subset of $Y_{i-1}$, we know that $y_m$ is visible in $Y_{i-1}$. Therefore, $\forall y_p \in Y_{i-1}, \exists x$ such that $y_m(x) \geq y_p(x)$. Since $Y_{i-1} \subset Y_{i}$, $y_i$ must cover up $y_m$ in $Y_i$ where it was visible in $Y_{i-1}$. Thus, $y_i(x_{m, m-1}) > y_m(x_{m, m-1})$ where $(x_{m, m-1}, y_m(x_{m, m-1}))$ is the intersection of lines $y_m$ and $y_{m-1}$.

We also know that $y_{j_k}$ is also visible due to its definition, so $m < k$. However, we defined $y_{j_k}$ to be the \textit{last} line in $Y_t$ such that $y_{j_k}(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}}) \geq y_i(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}})$ where $(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}}, y_{j_k}(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}}))$ is the intersection of lines $y_{j_k}$ and $y_{j_{k-i}}$.

Contradiction! \contradiction

Therefore, by contradiction, if $Y_t = \{ y_{j_1}, ..., y_{j_k} \}$ is the visible subset of $\{ y_1, ..., y_{i-1} \}$ where $t \leq i - 1$, then $\{ y_{j_1}, ... y_{j_k}, y_i \}$ is the visible subset of $\{ y_1, ..., y_i \}$ where $y_{j_k} \in Y_t$ is the last line in $Y_t$ such that $y_{j_k}(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}}) > y_i(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}})$ where $(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}}, y_{j_k}(x_{j_k, j_{k-1}}))$ is the intersection of lines $y_{j_k}$ and $y_{j_{k-i}}$.

\section{Proof of Algorithm 3}

For a set of lines, $Y_n = \{ y_1, ..., y_n \}$, we can determine the subset of visible lines using algorithm 3.

Base Case: If we only have 1 or 2 lines in the set, they are trivially visible.

Inductive Hypothesis: The set of lines $\{ y_{j_1}, ..., y_{j_t} \}$ is the visible subset of $Y_i = \{ y_1, ..., y_i \}$ where  $t \leq i - 1$.

Inductive Step: Consider the set of lines $Y_{i+1} = \{ y_1, ..., y_{i+1} \}$. Given the Inductive Hypothesis, we can determine the visible subset of $Y_{i+1}$ using Claim 2.

Therefore, by induction, algorithm 3 can correctly determine the subset of visible lines of a given set of lines, $Y_n = \{ y_1, ..., y_n \}$.

\section{Benchmarking Results and Analysis}

\includegraphics[scale=.70]{graph.png}

In the image above, about all we can tell is that the performance of algorithm 1 is far worse than the performance of algorithms 2 and 3. The graph is not very useful when in a linear scale.

\includegraphics[scale=.70]{loglog.png}

Once we applied a logarithmic scale to both axes on the graph, the results are far more easy to see. 

According to the trendline, if we had tried to run a benchmark for algorithm 1 for 9,000 random equations, it would have taken almost 27 days to complete, whereas algorithm 3 was able to accomplish it in under half a second.

If each algorithm were to run for an hour, then:

\begin{itemize}
	\item algorithm 1 could process around 1050 equations
	\item algorithm 2 could process around 9566 equations
	\item algorithm 3 could process around 77,088,900 equations
\end{itemize}

The slope of the regression line in the log-log plot is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 3.0052 for algorithm 1
	\item 2.2494 for algorithm 2
	\item 0.9862 for algorithm 3
\end{itemize}

3.0052 is pretty close to the 3 in $\Theta(n^3)$, the asymptotic runtime for algorithm 1. 2.2494 is below 3, so it fits $O(n^3)$, the asymptotic runtime for algorithm 2. Finally 0.9862 is pretty close to 1 in $\Theta(n^1)$, the asymptotic runtime for algorithm 3. All in all, the benchmarking results match our asymptotic runtime analysis.
