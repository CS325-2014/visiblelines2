\section{Proof of Claim 3}

Suppose we have two sets of visible lines, $Z = \{ z_1, ..., z_t \}$ and $Z' = \{ z'_1, ..., z'_s \}$, where each set of lines is ordered increasingly by slope, and the slope of $z'_1$ is greater than the slope of $z_t$. Let $Intersection(z_j, z_k)$ be the point of intersection with some $(x, y)$ between lines $z_j$ and $z_k$. 

Let $I  = \{ Intersection(z_j, z_k) | 1 \leq j \leq t - 1, k = j + 1, k, j \in \mathbb{Z} \}$.

Let $I' = \{ Intersection(z'_j, z'_k) | 1 \leq j \leq s - 1, k = j + 1, k, j \in \mathbb{Z}  \}$.

Now we have $I$ and $I'$, two sets of points that each form a convex polyline (since the lines in $Z$ and $Z'$ are ordered by slope and visible). Since these are two convex polylines, there is clearly only one point of intersection between them. This point must be an intersection between some line $z_i \in Z$ and some line $z'_j \in Z'$.

We can observe that $1 \leq i \leq t$ and $1 \leq j \leq s$. Clearly, based on the image of two convex polylines, we can see that $\forall z_x \in Z$ such that $x > i$, $z_x$ is not visible. Similarly, $\forall z'_x in Z'$ such that $x < j$, $z'_x$ is not visible.

Therefore, the visible subset of $Z \cup Z'$ is $\{z_1, ..., z_i \} \cup \{ z'_j, ..., z'_s \}$.

$\square$

\section{Proof of Algorithm 4}

\subsection{Proof of \textsc{MergeVisible}}

Suppose we have two sets of visible lines $Z = \{ z_1, ..., z_t \}$ and $ Z' = \{ z'_1, ..., z'_s \}$.
By Claim 3, we know that the two values $i$ and $j$ exist such that the visible subset of $Z \cup Z'$ is 
$\{z_1, ..., z_i \} \cup \{ z'_j, ..., z'_s \}$ where $i \geq 1$ and $j \leq s$.

Let $Intersection(z_j, z_k)$ be the point of intersection with some $(x, y)$ between lines $z_j$ and $z_k$. 

Let $I  = \{ Intersection(z_j, z_k) | 1 \leq j \leq t - 1, k = j + 1, k, j \in \mathbb{Z} \}$.

Let $I' = \{ Intersection(z'_j, z'_k) | 1 \leq j \leq s - 1, k = j + 1, k, j \in \mathbb{Z}  \}$.

Let $i,j = 0$.

Initially, $I(i)_y$ (the $y$ value of the first element of $I$) will be greater than $I'(j)_y$ (the $y$ value of the first element of $I'$) because the lines are ordered according to slope. We increase the index of the value with a smaller $x$ value until the value of $I'(j)_y > I(i)_y$. At this point, there had to have been a point of intersection between the two line segments $(I(i), I(i-1))$ and $(I'(j), I'(j-1))$. 

Therefore, we can use Claim 3 and this intersection range to determine the visible subset of $Z \cup Z'$.

$\square$

\subsection{Proof of Algorithm}

For a set of lines $Z_n = \{ z_1, ..., z_n \}$, we can determine the subset of visible lines using algorithm 4.

\textbf{Base Case}: If we only have 1 or 2 lines in the set, they are trivially visible.

\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis}: The two sets of lines $Z = \{ z_1, ..., z_t \}$ and $ Z' = \{ z'_1, ..., z'_s \}$ are each sets of visible lines ordered by slope increasingly, and the slope of $z'_1$ is bigger than the slope of $z_t$.

\textbf{Inductive Step}: Since we know that \textsc{MergeVisible} works, we can use it to find the subset of visible lines for $Z \cup Z'$.

Therefore, by induction, algorithm 4 can correctly determine the subset of visible lines using algorithm 4.
